# Dissertation
The repo contatins the Python notebook used for my dissertation. The notebook contains the code to implement a Q-learning agent in an single-leg flight with overbooking with a newly proposed oppotunity cost heuristic. There are 6 main sections in the notebook.
1. Import/Clean Arrival rates
2. Model Classes
3. Model Implementation
4. Bayesian Optimisation
5. Parameter Sensitivity
6. Effects of Oppotunity Cost

Some of the code will require manual adjustmnets and re-runs to simulate new senarios.

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas 
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- scipy
- itertools 
- colorama -v0.4.4
- bayesian-optimization
